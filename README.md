I actually planned to make a client side in c++ using Windows Forms, but I don't know the language well enough and in a fit of rage I deleted the client source code ヽ(#ﾟДﾟ)ﾉ. Perhaps I’ll make a demo in the console in c# for a start and then I’ll forget password from this account

the service with system rights became available to me, now I need to understand how to make the system environment application interact with the user environment (without using the file system for application communication :/ )
